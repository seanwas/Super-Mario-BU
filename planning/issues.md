# Priority Issues

1. SetInterval - Some of the SetInterval Timers are not clearing when they should be
2. Duplicate elements - When proceeding through the racks or after a death, sometimes duplicate elements will appear on the page
3. Active Screen - Needs to reset when player dies
4. Motion - Need to add motion to player for fluid movement


# Secondary Issues
1. Responsiveness - The game will only look and play correctly on my laptop. Larger and smaller screens create viewing issues
